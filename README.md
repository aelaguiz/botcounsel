Can convert the moderator to be an agent where each expert is a tool

It cna decide which experts to invoke or all of them one after another?

That seems like a lot
Lets just ask each of them every time fn and have it not be an agent



# Steps

1. Moderator clearly defines the problem statement for the other expert
2. Reseracher takes the problem statement and past context and retrieves relevent materials
3. All experts in parallel receive the guidance from the moderator, the research from the researcher, the chat history and reference their own work history. They produce a report. In a report they present questions that need to be clarified, ideas they are currently exploring, and conclusions they have reached
4. Moderator reviews reports from the experts, the research from the researcher and decides what to go back to the user with. They can go back with clarifying questions, or they can go back with conclusions, or they can go back with a blend of tentative conclusions as well as questions that need clarification.
5. Commentator takes the moderator's output and translates it into something that is suitable for direct communication with the user, this is where any tone/style is applied.
